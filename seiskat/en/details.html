<p>
  The regional competitions are organized in Helsinki, Oulu, Satakunta
  and Turku.  The competitions are separate from each other and in
  different regions they have different problems.  This means that the
  results of different regions are not comparable.
</p>

<p>
  The first round of the competition is held in schools and a final
  round in the university or in schools.  
  In each city, the best twenty contestants or
  so are invited to the final round. Furthermore, the top contestants
  are invited to participate in mathematics training.

<ul>
<li>Please make sure that the parents of the contestants have read the <a href="seloste.pdf">privacy policy</a> and permit us to handle the contestants&rsquo; personal information. This year we are piloting in Helsinki and Oulu the option that the students who are at least 13 years old give the permission themselves.</li>
  <li>
    Photocopying of the problem and answer sheets: Since we do not know
    how many participants there will be from each school, or which
    languages they prefer to use, we will mail only one copy of each
    translation of the problem sheet, and one copy of the answer sheet.
  </li>
  <li>
    The schools are allowed to translate the first round problems to
    other languages, if necessary.
  </li>
	<li> This year we are running the competition in some cities electronically and in some cities on pencil and paper. Below you can find instructions for both options.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="at-the-beginning-of-the-competition">At the beginning and during the competition: general instructions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    The problems of the first round are in multiple choice format. Each
    problem is worth one point. Wrong answers are not punished. The
    problems are not ordered in increasing difficulty, but the first
    problems are likely to be easier than the last ones.
  </li>
	  <li>
    The time allotted is 50 minutes. It is preferable to have a visible
    clock in the contest hall, or to warn the contestants when the
    competition is about to end.
  </li>
  <li>
    It is very important that the contestants are provided with enough
    scrap paper.
  </li>
  <li>
    It is advisable to stress to the contestants that the problems are
    meant to be difficult and therefore they shouldnâ€™t be worried if
    they can not solve most of them.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pencil">Pencil and paper</h3>

<ul>
		  <li>
    The problems and answer sheets will be mailed to the schools in
    Finnish, Swedish and English before the competition.
  </li>
	  <li>
    Because it is very important that each answer sheet has the name,
    address and school of the contestant written legibly on it, it is
    prudent to reserve around five minutes for filling in these details
    before the competition.
  </li>
  <li>
    The contestants only need writing and drawing instruments,
    i.e. pencils, an eraser, a ruler and a compass. In particular,
    calculators and mathematical tables are not allowed.
  </li>
	 <li>
    After the first round, it is only necessary to collect the answer
    sheets and mail them and a filled <a href="lomake.pdf">privacy policy form</a> to the address:
    <ul>
      <li>
	in Satakunta: Julia Vaahtera, Satakunnan ammattikorkeakoulu, PL
	1001, 28101 PORI.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    It is prudent to mail the answer sheets and the privacy policy form as soon as possible after
    the first round.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="electronic">Electronic competition</h3>

<ul>
 <li>The problems are given and answeres submitted electronically. The teacher gets a link to problems in the Viope system using school's account.</li>

	<li>   The contestants only need writing and drawing instruments,
    i.e. pencils, an eraser, a ruler and a compass. Exceptionally, in Helsinki, also
